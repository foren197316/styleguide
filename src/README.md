        Apartment searching in New York City can be overwhelming and stressful to
        say the least. In such a big city, it can even be difficult to decide where to start
        looking &mdash; Park Slope, SoHo, Tribeca, the Lower East Side, Chinatown? What's
        a borough? Which is better &mdash; <a href="#">uptown or downtown</a>?
      </p>

        So before you even start looking, do some research to understand and measure
        livability in your dream location. Look at housing quality, safety, shopping
        and services, nightlife venues, diversity, green space, etc. This might be a lot to
        consider, but it's important to go into detail since this city has so many great.
