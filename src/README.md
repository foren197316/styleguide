This is very much so a living document, here you'll find the beginnings
of documentation about how we build web applications at <strong>InterExchange</strong>.

## Getting Started

I recommend checking out <a class="label label-success" href="/javascript_-_tabs.html">JavaScript - Tabs</a>
where you'll find a really simple implementation of an existing tab.

You can start making changes to your areas of responsibility by simply
copying and pasting the html code into the cms.
