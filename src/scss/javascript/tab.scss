      Being an au pair abroad is a serious job.
      You'll need to be patient, kind, loving and extremely responsible as you care for your host children.
      You'll also need to communicate well with your host parents regularly about how things are going.
    </p>

      Au pairs' responsibilities vary, but most contribute to their host family households by:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <i class="fa fa-car"></i>
        Dropping the children off and picking them up from school or after-school activities
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <i class="fa fa-futbol-o"></i>
        Taking children to lessons, play groups, parks and other fun outings
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i>
        Helping children with homework
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece"></i>
        Assisting in keeping the children's rooms and play areas clean
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <i class="fa fa-cutlery"></i>
        Preparing snacks and meals for the children
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <i class="fa fa-calendar-o"></i>
        Staying home during school vacations, when a child is sick or on other unexpected days off
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Your responsibilities as an au pair are only related to child care. As a member of the household, you might contribute to small, everyday tasks like washing dinner dishes or taking the dog for a walk, but only in a way that is equal to the contributions of other members of the family.
